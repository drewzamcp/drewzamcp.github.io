## The 10 principles of good code 

### Short units of code 

15 lines max. Good benchmark


### simple units of code 

TOREAD: What is cyclomatic complexity? 

### write code **ONCE**

> stink parade is duplicated code - Martin Fowler


### Keep unit interfaces small

> interface:: how you interact with the code / function

fewer parameters == less complexity and viceversa

### Seperate concerns in modules

The requests library is amazingling structured and demonstrates the seperation og concerns or modularized design. 

Easy to see purpose of each module at a glance. 
namespacing.
Follows the Zen of python 
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- lets do more of those!

Don't be afraid to build out small seperated modules to piece together your solution. Smaller more distinct

### Couple architecture components loosely



### Keep componenets balanced

### Keep codebase small

complexity. readability. maintainability.

### Automate development pipelines and tests

test test test. 
continuous integration


### Write clean code 

Leave a place better than you found it.


#### Notes:

do the small things consistently.
