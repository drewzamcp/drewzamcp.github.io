# Welcome to SumData

Hi, I'm Andrew and this is my technical blog. If you happen to come across this, brilliant. You may be as confused as I am getting into Python, or you may be one of my new mentors at [PyBites](https://pybit.es) - Hi Bob, hey Julian!

However you stumbled across this, know this, it's possible that nothing here makes any sense. My intention for this blog is to improve my own understanding of the Python language. As of this writing, I'm in week 1 of the "PyBites Developer Mindset". I'm planning to document my journey through this 10 week program and do my best to develop a habit of writing my key learnings in this blog.
